# AI Prompts and Responses

## Prompt 1: Initial Design Brainstorming

**Prompt:**
"How can I make my ETL pipeline more object-oriented? Currently it's a single class with static methods for extract, transform, and load."

**AI Response Excerpt:**
"To make your ETL pipeline more object-oriented, consider breaking it down into these components:
1. A Product class to represent your data model
2. A FileHandler interface for I/O operations
3. A Transformer hierarchy for transformation rules
4. A main ETL class to orchestrate the process"

## Prompt 2: Product Class Design

**Prompt:**
"What fields and methods should my Product class have to represent the data being processed?"

**AI Response Excerpt:**
"Your Product class should encapsulate:
- Fields: productId, name, price, category, priceRange
- Methods for:
  - Getting/setting fields
  - Price range calculation
  - CSV conversion
This keeps all product-related logic in one place."

## Prompt 3: Transformation Strategy

**Prompt:**
"How can I make the transformation logic more flexible and extensible?"

**AI Response Excerpt:**
"Create an abstract Transformer class with:
- Abstract method for single product transformation
- Default implementation for batch transformation
- Concrete implementation for current business rules
This allows easy addition of new transformation rules."

## Prompt 4: Error Handling

**Prompt:**
"What's the best way to handle errors in an object-oriented design?"

**AI Response Excerpt:**
"Each class should:
- Handle its own specific exceptions
- Log errors appropriately
- Maintain clear error states
- Return meaningful error indicators
This distributes error handling to appropriate components."
