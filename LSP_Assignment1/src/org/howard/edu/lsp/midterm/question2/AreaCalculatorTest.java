// JUnit test source removed from main src compilation unit because JUnit is not
// available on the classpath in this workspace by default. If you want to run
// these as proper JUnit 5 tests, move this file into a test directory and run
// with JUnit on the classpath (e.g., using Maven/Gradle or the JUnit console
// launcher). A simple dependency-free test runner exists in
// AreaCalculatorSimpleTest.java which can be run directly.
